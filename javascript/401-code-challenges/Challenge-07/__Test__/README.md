# linked-list-insertions
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Create a Node and LinkedList Class that allows you to create a LinkedList. Create a method that takes in a number and returns the node’s value that is the numbers places from the tail of the linked list.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Challenge Type: Extending an Implementation


Feature Tasks  
Write the following method for the Linked List class:  


kth from end  
argument: a number, k, as a parameter.  
Return the node’s value that is k places from the tail of the linked list.  
You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges. 


## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
kth from end - O(n)/linear complexity


## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
kth from end


argument: a number, k, as a parameter.  
Return the node’s value that is k places from the tail of the linked list.  
You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.
