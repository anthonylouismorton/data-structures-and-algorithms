# linked-list-insertions
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Create a Node and LinkedList Class that allows you to create a LinkedList. Addtionally there are methods to see append a number to the end of a linkedlist, add a node before another node, and add a node after another node.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Challenge Type: Extending an Implementation


Feature Tasks  
Write the following methods for the Linked List class:  

append  
arguments: new value  
adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list  


insert before  
arguments: value, new value  
adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified  


insert after  
arguments: value, new value  
adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified  

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
append - O(n)/linear complexity
insert before - O(n)/linear complexity
insert after - O(n)/linear complexity

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
append  
arguments: new value  
adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list  


insert before  
arguments: value, new value  
adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified  


insert after  
arguments: value, new value  
adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified
