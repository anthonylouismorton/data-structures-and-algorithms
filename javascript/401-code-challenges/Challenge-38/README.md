# Graph
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Conduct a depth first preorder traversal on a graph

## Challenge
Write the following method for the Graph class:  

Name: Depth first  
Arguments: Node (Starting point of search)  
Return: A collection of nodes in their pre-order depth-first traversal order  
Program output: Display the collection  

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
depthFirst   
Time: O(|V|+|E|)  
Space: O(n)  

V = vertices  
E = edges
