# Tree Max
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.
Create a Binary Tree class that has a method that finds the maximum value within a binary tree.


## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Challenge Type: Extending an Implementation  


Feature Tasks  
Write the following method for the Binary Tree class  


find maximum value  
Arguments: none  
Returns: number  
Find the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.  


## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
find maximum value =  constant O(1)
helperFunction = linear O(n)


## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your trees -->
find maximum value  
Arguments: none  
Returns: number  
Find the maximum value stored in the tree. You can assume that the values stored in the Binary Tree will be numeric.
