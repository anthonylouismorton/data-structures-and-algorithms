# Graph
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Implement a breadth-first traversal on a graph.

## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Write the following method for the Graph class:  

breadth first  
Arguments: Node  
Return: A collection of nodes in the order they were visited.  
Display the collection  

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
breadthFirst
Time: O(|V|+|E|)
Space: O(n)

V = vertices
E = edges

## API
