# linked-list-zip
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Write a function that takes in two lists and combines them by alternating between nodes

## Challenge
Write a function called zip lists  
Arguments: 2 linked lists  
Return: Linked List, zipped as noted below  
Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list.  
Try and keep additional space down to O(1)  
You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class as well as the methods created in previous challenges.  



## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
merge - O(n)/linear complexity


## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
merge:

Arguments: 2 linked lists  
Return: Linked List, zipped as noted below  
Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the zipped list.
