# Breadth-first Traversal
<!-- Short summary or background information -->
Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the node, the left child node, and the right child node.  
Create a Binary Tree class that has a method that traverses a tree breadth first.


## Challenge
<!-- Description of the challenge -->
Challenge Type: Code Challenge / Algorithm 


Feature Tasks  
Write a function called breadth first  
Arguments: tree  
Return: list of all values in the tree, in the order they were encountered  
NOTE: Traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach  


## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->
breadth first =  linear O(n)


## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available in each of your trees -->
breadth first   
Arguments: tree  
Return: list of all values in the tree, in the order they were encountered  
NOTE: Traverse the input tree using a Breadth-first approach
